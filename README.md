# public-discord-bot
Hey, this is a simple discord bot to test. I have made it in python 3.6 because the discord api doesn't/didn't work with higher python 
this means you have to use 3.6 and install all requirements from requirements.txt 

Thanks for downloading my project.
I'm a beginner in this so if you have suggestions or something you are more than welcome to share.
